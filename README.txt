TapTapTap App - Alpha Release

Software Dependencies: 
* Minimum SDK Version: 15
* Maximum SDK Version: 23

Hardware Dependencies:
* Hardware that can support the software dependencies
* Internet connection will be required in future releases

How To Begin:
* The main menu has three selection options as follows:
  New Game - Begin a new game based off of selected game type (game type is selected after New Game is pressed).
  High Score - Display the current user high score. (High scores will be specific to game type and will include more than just the highest score in future releases).
  Settings - Currently displays an option to reset the dialog box checked, in case you want to see the intro message again and have already disabled it.

How To Play:
* Once a new game has begun, the goal is to score as many points as possible by typing letters and symbols correctly. 
* Each correct letter is worth one point and, at the end of the game, each correct word is worth one additional point per letter. 
* Any time a character is deleted one point is deducted.
* While a word is being typed only incorrect letters will appear red.
* Once the user has moved on to another word, previous words will appear fully green or fully red, indicating correctness.
* The goal is to complete the phrase as quickly and accurately as possible.
* In this version time to complete the paragraph does not affect the score, but in future releases a quick time will result in a score bonus!
